# The Copper & Blue News

Static fan site for [@thecopperandbluenews](https://www.instagram.com/thecopperandbluenews/). Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step.
Fan run. Not affiliated with the Edmonton Oilers or the NHL. Don't add official NHL/Oilers logos.

## Files
- `index.html`, `schedule.html`, `scores.html`, `players.html`, `cap.html`, `player.html?id=PLAYERID`, `game.html?id=GAMEID` (box score), `stats.html`, `posts.html`, `about.html`: pages
- `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`: styles and scripts
- `posts.json`: the posts feed (newest first by `date`)
- `data.json`: next game, latest result and standings (generated)
- `scripts/update_data.py`: rebuilds `data.json` from the NHL API
- `.nojekyll` turns off Jekyll.

> **Custom domain:** the `CNAME` file was removed until copperandbluenews.com is bought. Once DNS is set up, add back a file named `CNAME` containing `copperandbluenews.com` (or set it in Settings > Pages).
- `logo.jpg`, `favicon.ico`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `images/`

## Adding a post
Put the graphic in `images/`, then add an entry to `posts.json`:
```json
{"title": "Final: Oilers 4, Ducks 2", "date": "2026-11-05", "type": "final",
 "image": "images/final-2026-11-05.jpg", "caption": "..."}
```
`type` is `gameday`, `final`, or `recap`.

## Game data (CORS)
The NHL API (`api-web.nhle.com`) sends **no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header** (tested Nov 4, 2026), so
browsers can't call it. `scripts/update_data.py` (standard library only) fetches it and writes static JSON:
`data.json` (home cards), `data/schedule.json`, `data/stats.json`, `data/roster.json`, `data/players/<id>.json`, `data/live.json` and `data/games/<id>.json`
(box scores: boxscore + landing + right-rail). Finished games are cached in the repo and not refetched.

Pages are deployed by GitHub Actions (Settings > Pages > Source: **GitHub Actions**):
- `.github/workflows/site.yml`: on every push, every 3 hours and on demand. It refreshes the data, commits
  changes to `data/`, and deploys.
- `.github/workflows/live.yml`: cron every 10 minutes. If an Oilers game is live or starts within 30 min, it
  refreshes the data and deploys to Pages **without committing**, then re-dispatches itself, so a new deploy
  goes out roughly every 2 minutes until the final. Off game days each run exits in about 20 seconds.
  Public repos get free Actions minutes, and each job is far below the 6-hour job limit.

**Real delay:** the home live card and game page re-read the JSON every 30 s, bypassing cache. A change from the
NHL shows on the site after one cycle (about 2 to 3 min: run, deploy, Pages CDN). Scheduled cron can start
5 to 15+ min late, so the first live update may lag at puck drop. This is near-live, not pitch-by-pitch.
For true real-time (~10 s), a free Cloudflare Worker proxy could relay the NHL API with CORS headers
(needs a free Cloudflare account).

Refresh locally: `python3 scripts/update_data.py`
Times are shown in MT (America/Edmonton) and PT (America/Vancouver), converted from the API's UTC
`startTimeUTC`. Check: the Nov 5 Ducks game is `2026-11-06T01:00Z` = 7 PM MT = 6 PM PT.

## Cap & contracts (manual, source: PuckPedia)
The NHL API has no contract data. Mac chose **PuckPedia** (https://puckpedia.com/team/edmonton-oilers) as the source.
Its robots.txt (checked Nov 4, 2026) blocks this site's bot (`Grokbot` / `xai-crawler`: `Disallow: /`), and its
terms page returned 403. So nothing is fetched automatically, and the figures are **entered by hand**.
The site credits "Contract data: PuckPedia" with a link and the as-of date.

`data/contracts.json` holds:
- **League figures:** the 2026-27 cap ceiling of $104.0M, the $76.9M floor and the $20.8M max salary, from the
  [NHL.com announcement](https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-nhlpa-announce-team-payroll-range-for-2026-27-season).
- **Team and player contract fields:** left blank (`null`) until entered.

To refresh:
1. `python3 scripts/update_data.py && python3 scripts/make_contracts_template.py`. This adds new roster players
   and keeps the numbers you already entered.
2. Open the Oilers page on PuckPedia in your browser. In `data/contracts.json`, fill per player: `capHit`,
   `salary` (this season), `yearsLeft`, `expiry` (e.g. 2028), `status` (UFA/RFA), `clauses` (e.g. "NMC").
   For the team, fill `team.capHit`, `team.capSpace`, `team.ltir`, and `team.deadCap` entries
   (`{"name","type","capHit","through"}`). Then set `asOf` (YYYY-MM-DD). Numbers are plain integers
   (e.g. 12500000). Leave unknown values as `null`.
   Check PuckPedia's terms allow showing this data on your site first.
3. Commit and push. The site redeploys on push.

## Run locally
`python3 -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000

## Deploy: GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repo (e.g. `copperandbluenews-site`) and push these files to `main`.
2. Repo **Settings > Pages**: Source "GitHub Actions" (the workflows deploy the site).
3. Custom domain: `copperandbluenews.com`. Set it in Settings > Pages (with Actions deploys the `CNAME` file isn't used, but keep it too). Turn on **Enforce HTTPS** after DNS works.
4. DNS at your registrar:

| Type  | Name | Value |
|-------|------|-------|
| A     | @    | 185.199.108.153 |
| A     | @    | 185.199.109.153 |
| A     | @    | 185.199.110.153 |
| A     | @    | 185.199.111.153 |
| AAAA  | @    | 2606:50c0:8000::153 (also 8001, 8002, 8003) |
| CNAME | www  | `copperandbluenews.github.io` |

Optional: verify the domain under GitHub **Settings > Pages > Verified domains** (adds a TXT record).

## Deploy: Cloudflare Pages
1. Cloudflare dashboard > **Workers & Pages > Create > Pages > Connect to Git**, pick the repo.
2. Framework preset: None. Build command: (blank). Output directory: `/`.
3. **Custom domains > Set up a domain**: `copperandbluenews.com` and `www.copperandbluenews.com`.
4. DNS: easiest is to add the domain to Cloudflare (change the registrar's nameservers to Cloudflare's), and Cloudflare creates the records:
   - `CNAME @ -> <project>.pages.dev` (proxied, flattened at the apex)
   - `CNAME www -> <project>.pages.dev` (proxied)
   An apex domain on Cloudflare Pages requires Cloudflare nameservers. Without them only `www` (CNAME) works.
